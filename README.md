# My_Portfolio

## Description

This Portfolio showcases all my work as an aspiring web developer. I created a simple layout that offers a few words about myself, displays my web projects, and provides information on how to contact me. I used to CSS to style my page and I utilized flexboxes and media inquires to ensure that my portfolio displays properly on both desktop computers and mobile devices. I only have one actual project to showcase at this time, but I have used placeholders while I continue to add to my body of work.

This current version of my portfolio is far from the finished article. I am still learning as a developer, and I have much to do to further polish and refine this webpage.
